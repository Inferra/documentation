Welcome to the Inferra docs! Inferra makes it easy to access the leading open source AI models with only a few lines of code. Our mission is to build the best AI-native platform for developers to build their own AI applications.

We currently offer:

* **Serverless LLM Inferra** - Use the API to access the top open source language models like [Llama-3.1-8B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B). Pay only for the tokens you use. View the list of available models [here](https://docs.inferra.net/resources/models).

* **LoRA Inferra (**[**Early access**](mailto:support@inferra.net)**)** - Upload LoRA adapters and access them via streaming or [batch](https://docs.inferra.net/batch-api) endpoints.

* **Image Generation (**[**Early access**](mailto:support@inferra.net)**)** - Generate images with models like [FLUX\[DEV\]](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev) and [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5). Pay per generation.
